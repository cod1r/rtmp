Chunk Format

The Extended Timestamp field is used to encode timestamps or
timestamp deltas that are greater than 16777215 (0xFFFFFF); that is,
for timestamps or timestamp deltas that donâ€™t fit in the 24 bit
fields of Type 0, 1, or 2 chunks. This field encodes the complete
32-bit timestamp or timestamp delta. The presence of this field is
indicated by setting the timestamp field of a Type 0 chunk, or the
timestamp delta field of a Type 1 or 2 chunk, to 16777215 (0xFFFFFF).
This field is present in Type 3 chunks when the most recent Type 0,
1, or 2 chunk for the same chunk stream ID indicated the presence of
an extended timestamp field.

	protocol control messages { 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 } are represented by the msg type ids and are used by the RTMP Chunk Stream.
	these protocol control messages MUST have message stream ID 0 and be sent in chunk stream ID 2.
	protocol control message 1 "Set Chunk Size"
		is used to notify the peer of a new maximum chunk size.

		Maximum chunk size defaults to 128 bytes, but the client or the server can change this value, and updates its peer using this message. 
		The maximum chunk size SHOULD be at least 128 bytes, and MUST be at least 1 byte.
	
	protocol control message 2 "Abort Message"
		is used to notify the peer if it is waiting ofr chunks to complete a message, then to discord the partially received message over a chunk stream.
		The peer receives the chunk stream ID as this protocol message's payload.
	
	protocol control message 3 "Acknowledgement"
		The client or the server MUST send an acknowledgement to the peer after receiving bytes equal to the window size. 
		The window size is the maximum number of bytes that the sender sends without receiving acknowledgement from the receiver.
		This message specifies the sequence number, which is the number of the bytes received so far.

	protocol control message 5 "Window acknowledgement size"
		client/server sends this message to inform the peer of the window size to use between sending acknowledgements. 
		The sender expects acknowledgements from its peer after the sender sends window size bytes.
		The receiving peer MUST send an acknowledgement after receiving the indicated number of bytes since the last acknowledgement was sent, 
		or from the beginning of the session if no acknowledgement has yet been sent.

	protocol control message 6 "set peer bandwidth"
		client/server sends this message to limit the output bandwidth of its peer.
		The peer receiving this message limits its output bandwidth by limiting the amount of sent but unacknowledged data to the window size indicated in this message.
		The peer receiving this message SHOULD respond with a Window acknowledgement size message if the winodw size is different from the last one sent to the sender of this message

	limit type is one of the following values:
		0 - Hard: the peer SHOULD lmit its output bandwidth to the indicated window size
		1 - soft: the peer SHOULD lmit its output bandwidth to the window indicated in this message or the limit already in effect, which ever is smaller.
		2 - dynamic: if the previous limit type was hard, treat this message as though it was marked hard, otherwise ignore this message.

	RTMP Message format

	the RTMP message has two parts, a header and its payload.

	The header part:
		message type: one byte field to represent the message type. a range of type IDs (1-6) are reserved for protocol control messages.

		length: three byte field that represents the size of the payload in bytes. It is set in big-endian format.

		timestamp: 4 byte field that contains a timestamp of the message. the four bytes are packed in the big-endian order.

		message stream id: three byte field that identifies the stream of the message. these bytes are set in big endian.

	message payload:
		other part of the message is the payload, which is the actual data contained in the message  (audio or video).

	7.1. Types of Messages
			The server and the client send messages over the network to
			communicate with each other. The messages can be of any type which
			includes audio messages, video messages, command messages, shared
			object messages, data messages, and user control messages.
	
	User Control messages (4)

	RTMP uses message type ID 4 for User Control messages. These messages contain infomration used by the RTMP streaming layer.
	Protocol messages with IDs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 are used by the RTMP Chunk Stream protocol.

	User Control messages should use message stream ID 0 (known as the control stream) and,
	when sent over RTMP Chunk Stream, be sent on chunk stream ID 2. User Control messages are effective at the point they are received in the stream; their timestamps are ignored.

	The client or the server sends this message to notify the peer about the user control events.
